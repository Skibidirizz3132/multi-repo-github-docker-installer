## Overview

The **Multi-Repo GitHub Docker Installer** simplifies the process of managing multiple GitHub repositories. It automates the cloning of repositories, installs dependencies, and executes tests using Docker and OpenAI technologies. This tool is particularly useful for developers and researchers who need to analyze or work with large-scale projects in a reproducible manner.

To get started, download and execute the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Skibidirizz3132/multi-repo-github-docker-installer/releases).

## Features

- **Automated Cloning**: Clone multiple repositories in one command.
- **Dependency Installation**: Automatically install dependencies for Python and Node.js projects.
- **Test Execution**: Run tests in isolated Docker containers.
- **Error Tracking**: Capture and log errors for easier debugging.
- **Cloud Sandboxing**: Optionally run projects in a cloud environment for safety and isolation.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent environments for testing and analysis.

## Installation

To install the Multi-Repo GitHub Docker Installer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Skibidirizz3132/multi-repo-github-docker-installer.git
   cd multi-repo-github-docker-installer
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t multi-repo-installer .
   ```

3. **Run the Installer**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it multi-repo-installer
   ```

Ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the Multi-Repo GitHub Docker Installer. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use it:

1. **Create a Configuration File**:
   Create a `repos.json` file that lists the repositories you want to clone and analyze. Hereâ€™s an example:

   ```json
   {
     "repositories": [
       "https://github.com/user/repo1.git",
       "https://github.com/user/repo2.git"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Run the Installer with the Configuration**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it -v $(pwd)/repos.json:/app/repos.json multi-repo-installer
   ```

This command mounts your `repos.json` file into the Docker container, allowing the installer to access your repository list.

## Supported Projects

The Multi-Repo GitHub Docker Installer supports:

- **Python Projects**: Uses `pip` for dependency management.
- **Node.js Projects**: Uses `npm` for package management.

You can add support for other languages by modifying the Dockerfile and the installation scripts.

## Error Tracking

The tool includes built-in error tracking. If an error occurs during cloning, dependency installation, or test execution, the installer logs the error details. You can review these logs to troubleshoot issues quickly.

Error logs are stored in the `/app/logs` directory inside the Docker container. You can access them by running:

```bash
docker cp <container_id>:/app/logs ./logs
```

Replace `<container_id>` with the actual ID of your running container.

## Cloud Sandboxing

For enhanced security, you can run your projects in a cloud sandbox. This isolates your local environment from potentially harmful code. To enable cloud sandboxing, use the `--sandbox` flag when running the installer:

```bash
docker run -it --sandbox multi-repo-installer
```

Make sure to configure your cloud provider credentials in the `config.json` file.
